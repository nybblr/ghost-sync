Ghost Sync
==========

Love [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), but want to version your blog posts with Github?

Ghost Sync gives you the best of both worlds:

- Edit your posts directly from Ghost's awesome interface
- Sync to a local Github repository (markdown + YAML frontmatter)
- Make edits locally and push changes back to Ghost
- Made changes on both sides? Start a sync, then resolve merge conflicts!
- Sync images so you can optimize to your heart's content
